9. [(Jan, 2021) Scaling Laws for Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01293.pdf)
    - Authors study scaling laws for transfer learning, including task-transfer and domain-transfer.
      1. _Did they test it on domain-transfer in a same task?_
    - They proposed "effective data transfer" to quantify the ability of pre-training.
      1. _how to measure "effective data transfer"?_    
    - They concluded that transfer scales predictably in terms of #param, #data and #compute.
      1.  _task-transfer or domain-transfer?_
      2.  _Can we use it to estimate the upperbound of transfer learning with a resource constraint?_

12. [(Jan, 2020) Scaling laws for neural language models](https://openai.com/research/scaling-laws-for-neural-language-models)
    - Authors study scaling laws for language models from a large-scale experiments.
    - They find that the cross-entropy loss scale as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training.
      1. _scaling laws can be formulated as a mathematics formulation?_ 
    - These findings let us determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget.
      1. _How to achieve this goal?_
      2. _If training resource is a constant, can we predict the training loss? If yes, can we use it to infer the best training configs?_ It seems like a upper-bound for a model.
