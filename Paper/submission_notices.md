# Submission notices
## Presentation
1. Keep design clean: "clean" denotes that the information is organized, sized and aligned in a visually pleasing and easy-to-understand way. Usually, a slide should contain 20% text + 40% graphics + 40% white space.
2. Color and font selection
- Use an easy-to-read font (Arial and Helvetica), particularly a sans serif.  
- If only conveying one idea or convering only one project, monochromatic is a great choice.
- If you want state comparisons, complimentary colors work best.
- If you are creating something very dynamic, large, and with several different roles, ideas or projects, then triadic colors are good choices.
