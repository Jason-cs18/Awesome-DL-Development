## Continuous Learning
Continuous learning is a widely used approach for overcoming domain and data shifts that occur after model deployment. While many AI works aim to propose a generalized model that can fit all data, this expectation is difficult to achieve in the real world due to non-IID assumptions between training and testing data. To address this issue, ML engineers and researchers must retrain deployed models on new and recent data.

However, unlike regular retraining, continuous learning on edge devices faces several constraints due to limited resources. As a result, recent efforts have focused on designing multiple new continuous learning systems that balance learning performance and costs.
