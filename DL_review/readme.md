# Dive into Deep Learning (Mu Li, Amazon AI)
## Introduction
Review four components (data, models, objective functions and optimization algorithms) behind deel learning (supervised-/semi-supervised-/unsupervised-/reinforcement-learning) and use specific examples (regression, classification, tagging, search, recommender systems and sequence learning) of supervised learning to introduce high-level idea.
## Preliminaries
- data manipulation (basic usage for tensor)
- data preprocessing (basic usage for pandas)
- linear algebra (basic theory for deep learning)
- Calculus (basic theory for deep learning)
- Automatic Differentiation (basic usage for torch)
- Probability (basic theory for deep learning)
- Documentation (Pytorch API and tutorial)
